Legal information by topic
============================

The primary way our legal information is displayed to websites users is by topic, organized around  primary legal categories using a taxonomy (our navigational IA):

* Family & Safety
* House & Apartment
* Money & Debt
* Health & Benefits
* Business & Work
* School & Education
* Immigrants & Immigration
* Voting & Civil Rights
* Crime & Traffic
* Court & Hearings

From the home page, five topics display, ordered by the navigational IA row weight.

.. note:: Legal content is tagged to 2 different taxonomies. Navigational IA drives the browsing content; the legal issues IA powers Get Legal Help.

The main landing page for each of the 9 top-level categories shows all of the second level terms with the top 4 articles in each level 2 category. 

Clicking on the "View all" when there are more than 4 items will open the subcategory page. This page shows an image, the category title and description and then all of the various pieces of legal content organized by level 3 category.
