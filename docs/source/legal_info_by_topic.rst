Legal information by topic
============================

The primary way our legal information is displayed to websites users is by topic, organized around our 9 primary legal categories using a taxonomy (our navigational IA):

* Family & Safety
* House & Apartment
* Money & Debt
* Health & Benefits
* Business & Work
* School & Education
* Citizens & Immigration
* Crime & Traffic
* Court & Hearings

From the home page, the 5 most popular topics from the navigational IA within each category. Popularity is based on page views in the last 60 days for all published content within the category.

.. note:: Legal content is tagged to 2 different taxonomies. The legal issues taxonomy was used to drive our front-end. Its polyhierchial nature cause significant overtagging and made it more difficult to find the most relevant legal content for a specific issues. In July 2022, we implemented the navigational IA taxonomy as the driver of front-end navigation. It is simpler, has fewer terms, and no term is tagged to multiple legal issues.

The main landing page for each of the 9 top-level categories shows all of the second level terms, along with the top 4 articles in each category. On mobile, only the 1st category is open with the remaining terms collapsed by default to improve scannability.

Clicking on the "View all" when there are more than 4 items will open the subcategory page. This page shows an image, the category title and description and then all of the various pieces of legal content.

Items are ordered by:

* Sticky at top of list (when tagged, these will appear first)
* Page views descending (based on last 60 days)
* Date revised descending

.. note:: Only Legal Problems can be marked sticky to appear first on the list.
