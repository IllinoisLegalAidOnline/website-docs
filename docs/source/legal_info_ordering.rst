Tagging Content to Navigation Terms
=======================================
Content team members may prioritize certain content to show up higher than other content.
This is done by editing the taxonomy term(s) and adding content to the Top Content field.

Each language can have it's own top content, reflective of different priorities for different audiences. The easiest way to edit a taxonomy term is to browse to the page on the site and click "Edit".

.. note:: Please work with the Legal Content Director on how to prioritize what content to show first. We do not yet have standards developed.


On the top level category pages
===================================

Cards within categories on top level pages can be ordered by either:

* Click on the subcategory title
* Edit that page
* Select items to add to the top content section; when these are added, that will be the default order, followed by page views descending.

OR through the Taxonomy Manager


.. note:: On mobile, only the top subcategory is expanded by default.


On subcategory pages
=========================

The ordering on subcategory pages will depend on whether content is tagged to a 3rd level category in that section or not.

See :ref:`manual_reordering`.
