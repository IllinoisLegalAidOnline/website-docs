Get Legal Help
=======================

Overview
===========

Get Legal Help is ILAO's tool for matching individuals to available legal representation and other human services. This includes:

* Partner organizations who accept applications via our online triage and intake system (OTIS)
* Other legal aid organizations who have completed a profile indiciating that they provide direct representation, mediation services, or other legal services
* Bar referral services
* Legal self-help centers
* Other social services where appropriate

It also connects individuals to appropriate legal information and forms.


Guiding Principles
======================

Get Legal Help was built and maintained with the following principles in mind:

* Legal aid is not available for everyone in every location, for every legal problem. Get Legal Help exists to help users find available resources; that includes legal information and forms when appropriate.
* Legal aid organizations want to say no less often and guiding potential applicants to legal information is a good option when the applicant's case doesn't fit priorities.
* Maintaining accurate case acceptance and organizational information should be easy to maintain by outside partners and ILAO staff.
* The process of determining what help is available should be transparent, easy, and provide a positive user experience.
* Spanish language users should have the same experience with the system as English speakers/readers.
* Get Legal Help should be available on the web and over text messaging.
* Where appropriate, the system should support an ongoing relationship with individuals so that they can retrieve their past applications and referral matches.
* Sufficient data should be collected to continually improve the referrals provided.
