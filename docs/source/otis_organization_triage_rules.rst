Triage Rules Content
===========================

Triage rules have two parts:

* Triage rule node (this is the content that a webform is attached to). The triage rule node

* An associated webform

Organization Managers can access these two lists of pages from their `dashboard <href="https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/users">`_:

The triage rule content type is where you can set:

* Title for the triage rule content
* The service(s) the triage rules apply to
* The legal issues the triage rules apply to. 
* The webform to associate with the triage rules. This must be added **AFTER** the webform triage rules has been created. This should always be set to open.
* The group audience should be the organization.

To edit your triage rule content:

* Pick edit node from the drop down. The settings for "relation" attach the content (node) to the organization.
* Update the edit form
* Press "Save (this translation)"

.. note::  Use caution when selecting legal issues for a service. If multiple triage rules exist for the same service, the system will randomly pick which one to use.
