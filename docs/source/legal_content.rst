Legal Content
========================


Overview
============

Legal content includes the creation, updating, and managing of legal content. This includes text articles, guides, videos, Easy forms, blank forms, and other legal information for the public. It also includes resources for lawyers including lawyer manuals and IICLE content.

Guiding principles
=====================

* ILAO legal information is easily findable from common search engines and similar platforms as well as within the website.
* Consumers can quickly assess if a specific resource is what they are looking for (title, description, categorization, format, headings, etc).
* While legal issues may differ, we can agree on a standard framework to apply across legal issues to ensure standardization and uniformity in our legal content. To the extent practicable, we want to have a standard library of components or templates for creating content.
* Regardless of the channel in which information is delivered, it works well for consumers of that channel.
* In an ideal world, content is created once and works across known channels without changes to the information itself; presentation may change based on channel.
* Spanish consumers will have equal access to information as English language consumers, to the extent that the information is within ILAO’s control.
* Both the technical systems and information will be fully accessible to consumers with disabilities.
* We are not representative of our consumers; the input of members of the communities we serve and those who are most likely to benefit from our services  is critical to the development of legal tools and information design and delivery.
* We will actively engage consumers and potential consumers from within the communities we serve in our development processes and information design and delivery and will compensate them appropriately.
* ILAO delivers reliable and accurate legal information. (Legal information will be reviewed no less than once every 18 months, with a target of once per year.)
* ILAO leverages AI, automation, and APIs to streamline its systems and processes to allow staff to focus on critical tasks.
* Consumers encounter ILAO’s products and services at various stages of their legal issues. We can’t assume consumers will start at any given place.
* Consumers often need help understanding if their problem is legal and if the available legal options will in fact get them what they want.
* Empathy and understanding people’s journeys and lived experiences are critical to the development of our services and products.
* Content creators and maintainers are important users of the system. The CMS should strike a balance between the needs of consumers and providing a positive user experience for those creators.
* ILAO’s products and services reflect ILAO’s brand and core values.
