===========================
Next Step Interim Process
===========================

Because the NextSteps Flows were originally designed to work with the Legal How-to that we are revising and have paused, these are the interim steps for creating a Next Step flow:

* Find the best Legal Content of type "How-to" to use as the primary source of legal information.
* Create a legal step for each process step in the How-to. For this you need to:

  * Enter the step title; this should align with the process step title.
  * Add a disambiguation tag for the specific legal issue to tell different steps apart.
  * Remove the Step information
  * Tag to Illinois
  * Remove the Negate jurisdiction field
  * Ignore all other fields
  * Leave unpublished

* Create a legal how-to to act as a dummy how-to. for this you need to:

  * Create a title; this title should match or be similar to the Legal content how-to
  * Add a content description and meta description
  * Tag to a legal category, primary legal category, and navigation term
  * Set legal position
  * Add steps
  * Set to "unpublished"

* Create the next step flow. Because the legal steps contain no information, we can not include steps in the "Include" fields.

Follow the information on creating a next step flows to create the actual flow.
