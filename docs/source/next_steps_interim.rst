===========================
Next Step Interim Process
===========================

Because the NextSteps Flows were originally designed to work with the Legal How-to that we are revising and have paused, these are the interim steps for creating a Next Step flow:

* Find the best Legal Content of type "How-to" to use as the primary source of legal information.

* Create a Legal Step for each process step in the How-to. For this you need to:

  * Enter the step title; this should align with the process step title.
  * Add a disambiguation tag for the specific legal issue to tell different steps apart.
  * Remove the Step information
  * Tag to Illinois
  * Remove the Negate jurisdiction field
  * Ignore all other fields
  * Leave unpublished

* Create a Legal How-to to act as placeholder how-to that can be referenced in NextSteps. for this you need to:

  * Create a title; this title should match or be similar to the Legal content how-to and include any information an intake caseworker may need to know to select. For example:

    * Applying for TANF benefits
    * Appealing a TANF decisions (was receiving benefits)
    * Appealing a TANF decision (was not receiving benefits) - the difference between this and the one above is that there is no option to continue benefits step in the process.

  * Add a content description and meta description. This can be generic as it is not exposed anywhere.
  * Tag to a legal category, primary legal category, and navigation term
  * Set legal position
  * Add steps
  * Set to "unpublished"

* Create the next step flow. Because the legal steps contain no actual content, we can not include steps in the "Include" fields.


See :ref:`NextStepsAuthoring` on how to create the actual NextSteps flow.

.. note:: Please keep these interim Legal Steps and Legal How-tos UNPUBLISHED so that they are not visible to website visitors or exposed to internal or external search.
