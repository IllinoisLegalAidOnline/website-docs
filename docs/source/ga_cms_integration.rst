======================================
Legal content CMS data for integration
======================================

To leverage our Google Analytics 4 data, we have a Tableau table that contains legal content metadata.


The required dataset includes:

* An export of the Find Legal Content report
* An export of the Navigational IA export (for second level categories)
* An export of the Legal Issues IA export (for top level categories)
* An export of the content formats taxonomy


.. note:: The exported taxonomy tables are required to combine and label taxonomy terms in English regardless of the content language.
