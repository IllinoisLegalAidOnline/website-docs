Sponsorship blocks
============================

Sponsorship blocks are created in the system using these steps:

1. Create a basic block. At this point, let Gwen know that the block is created. She will need to work with the developers for the remaining steps.

Technical steps:

2. A block visibility group is defined. This determines where a block appears. This can be limited to specific:

* Term reference
* Content level
* Specific pages if required

3. The block is placed in legal content using the layout builder

4. The configuration is saved.
