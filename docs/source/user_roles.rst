Account roles & permissions

Roles
========
We have the following roles:

 * **Legal self-help center navigator**. This should be given to navigators of LSHC locations that need to be able to post jobs, events, or manage their organization's profile.
 * **Law student member**. This is given automatically to anyone registering with a .edu email address. Law school staff at legal aid clinics are manually given other permissions as needed.
 * **Pro bono member**. Lawyers, paralegals who indicate when registering are given this role. Pro bono members can post jobs, events, and access legal content restricted to pro bono users.
 * **Legal aid member**. This should be limited to users who are current employees of a legal aid organization. If the user registered with a legal aid organization email, they will automatically be given this role. Volunteers at legal aid organizations should be given pro bono permissions.
 * **Translator**. This role is not active currently.
 * **Subject matter expert**. This role is not actively used but will be used to indicate that the user is a legal content volunteer as we build out our gamification features.
 * **Intern**. An intern at ILAO
 * **Staff**. A staff member at ILAO. This user has elevated permissions and can do most anything on the website.
 * **Content manager**. A member of the legal content team. This role is used exclusively to determine who gets content-related emails.
 * **API consumer**.  This is a special role for connecting to ILAO's APIs.

.. note:: Community members are not given any of the above roles. They are just "authenticated users" (that is, they can log in and access the basic permissions that all logged-in roles have). There will not be a role listed for these users in people reports.
