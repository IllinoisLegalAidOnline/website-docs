Intake settings

Organizations can manage their intake settings from a `report </admin/organizations/intake/settings>`_. that lists all of the intake settings that have been assigned to their organization. This report is filtered based on the current logged in user's groups (so ILAO staff won't see it the same way as our OTIS partners).

.. note::  All intake settings for an  organization will be listed here BUT unless they have been associated with the organization's group profile, the edit button will be missing on this report

Intake settings may also be edited by selecting "View entity" and then "edit" from the drop down on the group's entities list page(s).
