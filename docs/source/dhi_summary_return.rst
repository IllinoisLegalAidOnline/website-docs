User journey: Returning users
================================

Returning users have a dashboard that tracks their progress. The information on the dashboard depends on where they are in addressing their debts:

Visitors can:

* Be working on one or more options for a specific debt
* Have prioritized debts in their queue
* Have one or more specific debts in their profiles that they have not yet started on an option for
* Have completed or archived debts
* Have never prioritized their debts

Visitors with active options
================================

An active option is one in which:

* It is tied to a specific debt
* The user has marked it as a "Yes"

.. note:: The user may or may not have actively started working on the option.

From each active option, the visitor will see:

* name of the debt
* title of the option
* the option's description
* a progress bar, based on the number of steps in the option and their individual progress
* a label repesenting the debt type
* a continue button that takes the user to the option page

Visitors with debts they haven't started on
