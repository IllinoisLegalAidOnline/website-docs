.. _manual_reordering:

============================
Legal content reordering
============================

By default, subcategory terms are ordered by weight and cards within subcategories and level 3 subcategories are ordered by page views descending. It is possible to also order these manually.

Ordering terms generally
============================

.. note:: Caching may cause changes to not be readily visible to anonymous users. Those may take 24 hours to appear. Reach out to Gwen if you need the changes to be visible sooner.


On the top level category pages
===================================

Cards within categories on top level pages can be ordered by either:

* Click on the subcategory title
* Edit that page
* Select items to add to the top content section; when these are added, that will be the default order, followed by page views descending.

OR through the Taxonomy Manager


.. note:: On mobile, only the top subcategory is expanded by default.


Top Level Categories
===================

On top-level category pages like "Family & Safety", the results are ordered by:

* Top content within each subcategory
* Page views descending
* Last substantive revision descending

As an example, on Family & Safety, if we we tagged "Random article" and "Random article 2" as the top two articles and the top 4 articles in terms of page views were Getting a divorce, Divorce, Responding to a divorce, and What if I can't find my spouse, viewers would see:

* Random article
* Random article 2
* Getting a divorce
* Divorce

Subcategory pages
====================

The layout of subcategory pages depends on how the subcategory is configured. 

No Remodeled Content
-------------------------

A subcategory has no remodeled content when there is no piece of content with a primary level 3 category attached to it. As soon as even one node is tagged with a primary level 3 category, the entire category changes to "Has remodeled content."

All content that has a navigational IA taxonomy term at the 2nd level will appear in that subcategory page **so long as it has not been remodeled.**

The primary level 2 category is used for breadcrumbs, not for navigation.


Has Remodeled Content
--------------------------

When a subcategory has remodeled content:

* All content that does not have a defined Primary level 3 category appears at the top without a heading.
* Content is then displayed grouped by the Primary level 3 category

.. note:: While content can be tagged to multiple level 3 categories in the navigational IA field, that will not have any impact on subcategory pages that have been remodeled. For example, Getting child support basics is tagged with a primary level 3 category within the Child support subcategory. It will only appear within that level 3 category on the Child support subcategory page. If it is also tagged to a level 3 category whose parent term has not been remodeled, it will not appear on that page.
