============================
Legal content reordering
============================

By default, content on top-level is grouped by subcategory and ordered by page views descending. Content on subcategory pages are grouped by level 3 term and ordered by page views descending.

On subcategory pages, content that is only tagged to the subcategory (level 2) will float to the top. 

Examples:

* Article A is tagged to Family & Safety -> Divorce and Family & Safety -> Protection from Abuse -> Domestic & Family Violence. On the Family & Safety page, it will appear in both Divorce and Protection from Abuse. On the Divorce page, it will appear at the top. On the Protection from Abuse page, it will appear in the Domestic & Family Violence section.
* Article B is tagged to Family & Safety -> Divorce and Family & Safety -> Divorce-> Filing for Divorce and Family & Safety -> Divorce -> Getting a divorce. On the Family & Safety page, it will appear in Divorce e. On the Divorce page, it will appear in the Filing for Divorce and Getting a divorce categories. It will not float to the top.


Ordering terms generally
============================

.. note:: Caching may cause changes to not be readily visible to anonymous users. Those may take 24 hours to appear. Reach out to Gwen or Mike if you need the changes to be visible sooner.

Top Category Pages
----------------------
Cards within categories on top level pages can be ordered by either:

* Click on the subcategory title
* Edit that page
* Select items to add to the top content section; when these are added, that will be the default order, followed by page views descending.

Or by accessing the Navigational IA under Structure -> Taxonomy and editing the term there (which leads to the same Edit form as above)


Subcategory pages
====================

.. note:: With the Sprint 169 deployment, the Primary Level 2 and Primary Level 3 single select fields will only impact breadcrumbs, not the navigation.

Cards within Level 3 terms on the subcategory pages must be edited thorugh the Navigational IA under Structure -> Taxonomy. For example, to organize how cards are displayed on Divorce, a content manager would need to edit the Filing for Divorce term for that section, the Getting a divorce term for that section, etc, etc.
