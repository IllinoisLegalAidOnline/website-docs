.. _manual_reordering:

============================
Legal content reordering
============================

By default, subcategory terms are ordered by weight and cards within subcategories and level 3 subcategories are ordered by page views descending. It is possible to also order these manually.

Ordering terms generally
============================

.. note:: Caching may cause changes to not be readily visible to anonymous users. Those may take 24 hours to appear. Reach out to Gwen if you need the changes to be visible sooner.


On the top level category pages
===================================

Cards within categories on top level pages can be ordered by either:

* Click on the subcategory title
* Edit that page
* Select items to add to the top content section; when these are added, that will be the default order, followed by page views descending.

OR through the Taxonomy Manager


.. note:: On mobile, only the top subcategory is expanded by default.


On subcategory pages
=========================

The ordering on subcategory pages will depend on whether content is tagged to a 3rd level category in that section or not.


For pages without 3rd level category terms
--------------------------------------------

This is the majority of topics while we work through implementing the new content model. For these pages, the ordering will match how they are ordered on the top category page. 

There is no ability to order differently on the top level and subcategory pages when the subcategory pages do not have 3rd level tags.

For pages with 3rd level category terms
----------------------------------------

For those pages that have 1 or more articles tagged to a 3rd level category term:

* Articles with no 3rd level category term appear at the top
* Articles with a 3rd level category term are grouped together in the order the 3rd level category terms appear in the navigational IA taxonomy

Articles within a 3rd level category can be ordered independently of the level 2 category display on the top category pages by:

* Using taxonomy manager to navigate to the 3rd level taxonomy term
* Adding in the relevant top content

.. note:: The top content items must be tagged to the 3rd level taxonomy term in order to appear there. Having an article appear in more than one 3rd level taxonomy is not supported.
