Adding an event
=====================

To create an event, a user must:

* Add a title (name of the event)
* Add the event's start and ending date/time
* Optionally, add a sponsoring organization. This is a text field.

.. note:: In earlier versions of the website, events were tied to organizations with inherited permissions and a separate set of fields had to be used for independent events. Starting in 2020, events are associated with individuals and not tied directly to any organization-based permissions.

* Select the event format:

  * In person - this will then add a field for an address
  * Online/Webinar, Telephone - this wil then add a field for instructions
  * Alert/notice - this is usually for something that has no online or in person component. Examples might be a window for a program, Pro bono week, etc.

* Add a required event description. This is the general body for the event details.
* Contact email. This defaults to the logged in user but can be changed. This is not displayed on the website but  may be used by ILAO if we need to contact someone about the event.

* Optionally, add 1 or more speakers.
* Select an audience. When legal community is selected, legal aid community and law students are automatically added; law students can then be removed if needed.
