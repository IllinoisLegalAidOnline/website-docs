=======================================
Legal forms and information
=======================================

We prioritize "best bets" over other options.

Best bets are currently defined as:

* A Guide, for legal information, that matches on the taxonomy term with depth
* An Easy form, form download, form link, or form that matches on the taxonomy term with depth

.. note:: This is probably not the ideal match up.

Legal content referrals are currently limited to legal content. This should likely be expanded to cover additional content types.

How content referrals are selected
====================================

Up to 6 results are returned. These are based on:

* legal content with a level of "Basic"
* portal main page content with a page type of "main page"
* ordered by page views descending
* are a match to the taxonomy term, with depth


.. note:: This is pending completion of DEV-3401
