========================
Online Intake Over SMS
========================

Online triage and intake is served over ILAO's short code. It relies on Guided Navigation to triage users and then collects information required to determine eligibility and e-transfer the case to an appropriate legal partner.

If the user texts a keyword that we can match to an existing Guided Navigation flow, we will direct the user directly into the online triage and intake system with the Guided Navigation flow already determined. If the texted keyword does not match a term, we will ask the user to pick from a menu.
