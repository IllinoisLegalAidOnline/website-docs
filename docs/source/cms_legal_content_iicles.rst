IICLE Content
===============

.. warning::
   IICLE content must be added using the IICLE content paragraph block and not the link paragraph block to ensure that the content access rules are enforced. Per our contract, IICLE content is limited to approved, logged in legal aid members.

IICLE relies on a proxy server on our end to pull the pages from IICLE into our website. IICLE content should be added:

* using the IICLE content paragraph block
* with a link that contains no query parameters (for example ?itemID=123)
* with a link that begins with https://www.iicle.com
* with a link that does not use https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/?proxy
