Working with CKeditor5

The full editor is used for legal content and basic pages. This is typically limited to staff, interns, and subject matter experts.

Specific features
===================

Spanish style
--------------
Marking text with the Spanish style will cause it to:

* Not appear on the English website
* Not be translated in the Spanish website
* Appear with a light blue background in the WYSIWYG

Insert link
---------------

When inserting a link, if you start to type a content title, it will automatically pull up content that matches. When selected, it will insert the /node/[nid] version which works across languages.

Press the green checkmark to insert. Use the red X to remove the link.

Insert image
---------------

Images can be uploaded into content. Decorative images should almost never be added within a WYSIWYG field. All images uplodaed into a WYSIWYG should have appropriate text alternatives that describe the image.
