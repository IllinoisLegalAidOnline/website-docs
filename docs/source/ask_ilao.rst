Ask ILAO
=================

Ask ILAO is built on a hosted LLM with retrieval-augmented generation. It relies on the legal content from IllinoisLegalAid.org to answer user queries. It has various guardrails to prevent:

* Providing answers to non-legal questions
* Using external sources to provide information

Limitations
=============

Ask ILAO does not have access to:

* Basic pages
* Get Legal Help and referral information
* External data
* Easy forms (it has access to the landing pages but not the interviews)
