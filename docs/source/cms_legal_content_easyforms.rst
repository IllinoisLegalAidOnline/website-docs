Easy Forms
======================

Each Easy Form must have an Automated Document block in Legal Content. Any legal content with an autoamted document block will be considered an Easy Form regardless of other blocks included on the page.

Each Automated Document block has:

* A brief form overview. This should be used instead of adding a separate text block. This overview will appear above any boilerplate and should explain to a website visitor what the program and/or forms will do for them.
* A link to a related guide, or if no guide is appropriate, another piece of legal content. This should be used instead of adding "Learn about [x]" within a text block.
* The label for the related link.
* A link ("Easy Form URL"). Easy Forms are hosted on other servers, such as LHI or ILAO's Docassemble server.
* Whether the program is mobile optimized are not. HotDocs-based interviews are not mobile-optimized. If an interview is mobile-optimized, a mobile friendly icon will appear on the page. If an interview is not, a laptop image will appear instead.
* Interview language. This is the language of the actual program used to generate the court forms. Court forms currently always render only in English.
* Document type. Does this interview result in court forms, letter, or something else?
* Qualifications to use this interview. This is a space to add any eligibility requirements to use the interview.
* Information required to complete the interview. This should include whatever information the individual should have available before starting the interview.
* Documents produced. This should be a list of documents the program may produce.
* Whether to include statewide forms information. Yes should only be marked for AOIC-approved statewide forms. When this is set to yes:

  * Whether to specify a direct link to use
  * Whether to direct someone to the AIOC site

* Time estimate - minimum number of minutes to complete to a maximum number of minutes to complete
* Whether the individual can stop and save their answers and return later.
