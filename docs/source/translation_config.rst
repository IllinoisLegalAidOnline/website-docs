Configuration translation
============================

Configuration translation is managed under `Configuration -> Region and Language -> Configuration translation <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/config/regional/config-translation>`_

Common configuration entities that may need translation are:

* Views
* Webform
* Easy
* Content fields


.. warning:: Only Gwen or Mike should be using configuration translation. Configuration translations (other than Webform must be backported to dev to be preserved in future deployments.
