=======================
NextStep Flows
=======================

NextStep Flows are an extension of ILAO's strategic goal to (virtually) accompany individuals along their legal journey. Most legal processes have multiple steps and NextStep flows are designed to follow up with individuals with reminders, ask them about their progress, encourage them to return to ILAO legal content and resources as needed, and better track outcomes and ILAO's impact.


Phase 1 (2023 - 2024)
====================
Phase 1, funded under a Technology Initiative Grant awarded to Legal Aid Chicago, NextSteps were created and launched as a plug-in to LegalServer instances of our OTIS partners building on our initial structured content model.

During the phase, the tool is only available to caseworkers at program partners. They place individuals who opt-in into the correct "last completed step" when providing limited advice or when they can't provide services. This then triggers the flow of interactive "flows" over SMS.

Phase 2 (2024 - 2026)
====================
 Phase 2 is funded under an expansion TIG grant awarded to Legal Aid Chicago between 2024 - 2026 envisions expansion:

* increasing the number of legal problems available through NextStep flows
* an expansion to include delivery over e-mail
* an expansion to IllinoisLegalAid.org in addition to LegalServer, where individuals who are viewing process content (How-to) where a NextStep flow is available can subscribe themselves to the service.
