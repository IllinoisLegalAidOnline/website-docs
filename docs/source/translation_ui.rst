Interface translation
======================

Interface translation is where we translate items that are not content and not configuration, typically text that is contained in custom code and exposed for translation.


This does not include:

* content [Content translation]
* blocks [Content translation]
* views (if you see edit view in the contextual menu, the string will not be in interface translation) [Configuration translation]
* webforms [Configuration translation]
* form fields, labels, help text [Configuration translation]
